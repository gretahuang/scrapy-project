Providing Example Data
----------------------

We humans are the learning machine behind this code, and we can't do it without real world data. If it doesn't work, start a new issue because we probably don't know. 

If you have a dataset that has lots of issues, add the data to a [gist](https://gist.github.com) and [create a new issue](https://github.com/derek73/python-nameparser/issues) so we can try to get it working as expected.

Feel free to update this documentation to address any questions that I missed. GitHub makes it pretty easy to edit it right on the web site now.
